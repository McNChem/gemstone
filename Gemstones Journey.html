			<p> A lone black cat with a twinkle in her eye, started on her journey. Dazed and confused, she ran on the wet path, annoyed by the
			droplets hitting her fur. She was in unfamilar terrority and her human was nowhere in sight.</p>
			
			<p>All she remembered was the horrible screeching, smell of fire, burning oil, and twisted metal.</p>
